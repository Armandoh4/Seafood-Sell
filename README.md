 ## Introduction
 Seafood Sell is a Demo for a real company which will sell seafood in London. The site provides live prices and an ability to add various items into a 'cart.' Once the customer wishes to proceed, they can edit and/ or finalise the order by entering their payment details.

 The site also aids in guiding users to the physical store, and offers insights into the operations of the business.

### Future Implementations
    In the furture I will expand on the complexity of the website, by adding moreproducts, including a way to purchase products without a login. I would also like to include a live chat feature, or a chatbot to make communicating with potential business partners easier.
